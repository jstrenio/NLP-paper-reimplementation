This project involves the fine-tuning of a BERT model and comparison with a sequence
scoring method that can be used in lieu of fine-tuning. The two methods are then tested
on a custom tailored version of the commonsenseQA dataset using next sentence prediction
for multiple choice question answering. An indepth report can be found
